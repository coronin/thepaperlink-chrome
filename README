ATTENTION:
 - Since v0.2.8, you can email the PubMed abstract with PDF attached to yourself. Details about this feature is at http://en.dogeno.us/?p=7601 . To achieve this, I have to change the access permission of the extension.

the Paper Link for PubMed
--------
In addition to existing PubMed search results, this extension will add direct PDF link; display F1000 scores, Impact Factor, Peaks and much more! It is built based on publicly available information from NLM / NCBI / NIH, and other sources. 

Detailed enhancement includes:
 * Impact Factor of the Journal
 * Direct link to its PDF file
 * External pages related to the article

This extension is built using API from http://pubmeder.appspot.com, http://thepaperlink.appspot.com and PubMed eUtils.

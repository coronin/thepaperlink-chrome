Whisper from the Developer:
 * single purpose: To display journal article related information not available at original PubMed
 * an old video demonstrating how to use https://youtu.be/kYWwsXxSHQs
 * in the browser address bar, type and search with keywords
 * background justification: after extract PMID from webpages, other params must tweak before making URL call. I process this on the background page using _port to communicate between content.js and background.js
 * contextMenus justification: I want the user to be able to do a PubMed search on any page with highlighted text
 * tabs justification: open related webpages, and update options after visiting /settings
 * activeTab justification: to extract PMID from a PubMed archived journal article, and provide a focused popup window using page_action
 * clipboardWrite justification: I add a clipboard icon on webpages allowing the user to click and storage formated references. I format the copied text based the PMID exacted from the webpage and using information available at PubMed
 * declarativeContent justification: to update contextMenus based on the webpage URL and text
 * storage justification: I give options to the user on how the exact information should be displayed and I archive the papers the user read for later, both need a storage permission
 * unlimitedStorage justification: to save those abstract text of read PubMed articles, I need a big storage. These items store locally, and will not be sync-ed
 * downloads and remote code at /jss
